	<h1>Homework 1!</h1>
	<h2>My Creative Statement:</h2>
	<p> My work explores the importance of friendship and company. The beauty of loving, caring and pure happiness. All the work here will consist of the little things that make</p>
	<p> me happy when hanging out with close friends. The close bond between friends help make the tiniest details huge impacts to someone. These tiny details make a sense of comfort</p>
	<p> which I intend to capture in my work.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p> These simple experiences become symbols for a group, showcasing how joy and comfort are produced. Such as the picture below, a simple game of "Spoons". But within the picture,</p>
	<p> you can see how one person is leaned in while another person's hands are gesturing around. We can also see how everyone is sitting close and in a circle. Friendships are incredibly</p>
	<p> important and meaningful, creating collective memories and security. </p>
